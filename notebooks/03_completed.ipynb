    "# Reading parquet the hard way\n",
    "\n",
    "Parquet is a cloud-native data format suitable for a variety of data types, including geospatial vector data. It is often described as being \"column-oriented\", as opposed to row-oriented like traditional databases and vector formats (though in reality parquet is really more of a hybrid format, one not strictly columnar).\n",
    "\n",
    "The cloud-native aspect of parquet mainly comes down to two facets of its design:\n",
    "\n",
    "* file metadata is consolidated at the end of a file, and can be read entirely in at most two requests\n",
    "* the metadata contains enough information for clients to selectively read only chunks that may contain targeted rows\n",
    "\n",
    "## Predicate pushdown\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"selective reading\" is done by a process called \"predicate pushdown\". Predicate pushdown enables clients to skip reading potentially massive amounts of data by leveraging things like chunk statistics and chunk bloom filters to restrict reads to only those chunks that _may_ potentially contain target data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an example like this SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT temperature\n",
    "FROM dataset\n",
    "WHERE\n",
    "  st_intersects(geom, AOI)\n",
    "  AND snow_cover_percent > 0\n",
    "  AND precipitation >= 10\n",
    "  AND land_cover NOT IN (\"rock\", \"urban\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see the user requesting the `temperature` variable from `dataset` records that have:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a geometry interseting the AOI\n",
    "* any snow cover\n",
    "* some significant precipitation\n",
    "* a non-impervious surface\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these conditions is called a predicate. Predicate pushdown means using predicates to filter what chunks to read from a file, or to even filter out whole files. File and chunk statistics provide a means of identifying files and chunks that cannot possibly have a record of interest per the query predicates, and skipping those. Of those remaining, bloom filters can provide another efficient check to eliminate chunks that cannot possibly contain target records. What chunks are left are then read and filtered by the client application using the actual values prior to returning the requested data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the language \"cannot possibly contain\" is used here specifically: we never want to miss a matching record, so we use techniques that give us means of eliminating chunks with certainty that they will not contain a recod of interest. These techniques come with the trade off that false positives can occur: we can rarely know that chunk _does_ have a target record. Sometimes we then read chunks without target records, because that is the only way to ensure they do not have what we are looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally though, predicate pushdown is an effective means of eliminating a large amount of data without having to read anything but metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a deeper understanding of parquet and how it works, we're going to examine the [Overture Maps Buildings dataset](https://docs.overturemaps.org/guides/buildings). We will find the geometry for the building we're in for this workshop, the AUT School of Business building.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is perhaps a bit contrived, because we'll start with a rough geometry for the building that we traced from aerial imagery in exercise 1, but the principles we'll be demonstrating are applicable generally for clients wanting to read from parquet, and will show how that process works in some detail. Key to the process will be a focus on using predicate pushdown with geometries, and how we can use less expensive bounding box operations to more effiicently eliminate chunks and records before turning to more expensive real-geometry comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `por-que` library\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate the learning experience, we'll use the author's custom python parquet parsing library, called `por-que`. This library is different from other, more efficient parsing libraries like `pyarrow`, in that it is designed for the educational experience. A core feature is the parsing of the entire file metadata, data page metadata, and byte structure of the file, which it exposes to users, unlike other tools that keep them hidden away as internal details.\n",
    "\n",
    "`por-que` can export the entire parsed structure to JSON, which can then be loaded, visualized, and explored with the [`ver-por-que` web application](https://teotl.dev/ver-por-que/). We'll see all of this in action through the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, let's get some prep out of the way, starting with the necessary imports."

    "## Loading one of these files using `por-que`\n",
    "\n",
    "`por-que` exposes three key classes, each of which we'll be using throughout the rest of this exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `AsyncHttpFile`\n",
    "* `FileMetadata`\n",
    "* `ParquetFile`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these, `AsyncHttpFile`, is a helper class that can open an HTTP(S) URL and expose it as a readable filelike object. We need this to allow the other two classes to do their parsing of the parquet files over HTTP.\n",
    "\n",
    "`FileMetadata` is a class that represents the block of metadata at the end of a parquet file. This metadata includes both file level information, like the schema, and chunk level metadata via row groups and their column chunks. Passing a readable filelike object into `FileMetadata.from_reader()` will parse the metadata object from said file.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ParquetFile` is a class that represents then entire physical and logical structure of a parquet file. This includes `FileMetadata`, but also all data page locations and metadata. `ParquetFile` and its nested `DataPage` objects allow reading data from the file. `ParquetFile.from_reader()`, similar to above, will parse the full structure and metadata from a passed in readable filelike object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we can use `AsyncHttpFile` with `ParquetFile` and some of what the latter exposes. Note that creating the `ParquetFile` instances has to make many random reads within the file, so this is not a fast process, especially over the network (typically taking around 30 seconds)."

    "### Reading the metadata for all files\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, we read the geospatial metadata for a file, but we need to do it for all files. Reading the metadata can be slow due to network round trips and latency. To make reading the metadata across all files possible in a somewhat reasonable amount of time we can leverage parallelism, but that comes at the cost of code complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the code below is creating an `AsyncHttpFile` instance for every file in our list. We open each of those instances within a context manager, so they will be automatically closed once we leave this context (because each consumes a not-insignificant amount of memory while they remain open). With each of those `AsyncHttpFile` instances we can create a corresponding `FileMetadata` instance via an async function call. We put all those async calls into a list, so we can use `asyncio.gather` to run them in parallel, and we `await` the completion of the gather to get all the produced `FileMetadata` instances. Again, parallelism allows us to make many HTTP requests for the data at once, instead of having to wait as we would when running requests serially.\n",
    "\n",
    "These `FileMetadata` instances we zip up with the corresponding URLs, and we use the resulting tuples to construct a dictionary keyed on the file URL. This gives us a mapping of a file's URL to its `FileMetadata` instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also collect and output the total number of bytes in this dataset summed across all files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: this process is rather slow. We have to download ~300 MB, parse and instantiate all of the metadata data structures. In testing this took anywhere from 2 to 5 minutes... If this takes too long, feel free to skip this part by reviewing the outputs in the completed notebook, and copy the `urls_that_intersect` values and define that before proceeding to steps that need those URLs.
