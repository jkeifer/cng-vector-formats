    "# Is GeoJSON cloud-native?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we'll explore GeoJSON format. We'll see exactly what does or does not make it cloud native.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding GeoJSON\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoJSON is, perhaps obviously, geospatial types in JSON. GeoJSON formalizes several object models for its various types, and specifies a way of encoding geometries and their properties within those object structures. Specifically, we have two discrete object types in GeoJSON: `Geometry` and `Feature`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Geometry` could be considered something of the most primitive type, the one on which `Feature` is built: features _have_ (optionally) a geometry. It's a composition relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Feature`s compose a `Geometry` (again, optionally, as technically a geometry is not required) with attributes. Every `Feature` can optionally have an `id` attribute, a `bbox` attribute, and any other custom attributes go into a feature's `properties` member.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these two discrete object types, GeoJSON also has two collections types: `FeatureCollection` and `GeometryCollection`. The former is effectively an object with an array of `Feature`s. The latter is a bit of a weirder one: it too defines an object with an array, but of `Geometry` objects. Except a `GeometryCollection` is also a valid `Geometry` type. But don't let that throw you, `GeometryCollections` aren't all that common so we won't worry about them from here on out.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these cases, a `type` attribute is used to specify an object is any one of these types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To summarize all of this\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GeoJSON types\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Feature` - has `type` (required), `geometry`, `properties`, `id` and `bbox` (all but `type` are optional)\n",
    "* `FeatureCollection` - has `type` (required), `features` (array, required), and `bbox` (optional)\n",
    "* `Geometry` - has `type`, `coordinates` (array, required), and `bbox` (optional)\n",
    "* `GeometryCollection` - has `type`, `geometries` (array, required), and `bbox` (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key points\n",
    "\n",
    "* `bbox` is optional on any of these\n",
    "* a feature's `geometry` attribute can be null\n",
    "* the 7 geometry types: `Point`, `MultiPoint`, `LineString`, `MultiLineString`, `Polygon`, `MultiPolygon`, `GeometryCollection`\n",
    "\n",
    "### To learn more\n",
    "\n",
    "We're not going too deep with GeoJSON. We don't need to do so to answer our question. But, if you want to learn more, GeoJSON is quie widespread and _many_ resources exist online. If I am going to call out any of them though, it would have to be the [GeoJSON RFC7946](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946) (because you should read RFCs, they are great) and anything by Tom MacWright on the topic (in chronological order, recommended to consume in that order):\n",
    "\n",
    "* [More than you ever wanted to know about GeoJSON](https://macwright.com/2015/03/23/geojson-second-bite)\n",
    "* [Falsehoods developers believe about GeoJSON](https://macwright.com/2016/06/05/falsehoods-developers-believe-about-geojson)\n",

We can also add attributes to the feature's properties in the interface.\n",

    "Woah, cool, that worked! So we _can_ selectively read GeoJSON to extract just what we want, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, yes, maybe. But look at what we had to do to make this work. We had use our knowledge of the structure of the GeoJSON feature collection in the original string to know that we in fact did have a feature collection from which we could read a feature. And that we had only one feature to read: using this character finding strategy is only effective with a single feature, and would break down if we added any more. Then we had to have _the whole GeoJSON string_ to be able to find those slice indices to finally be able to say which part of the GeoJSON we really wanted, to just read that part out and parse it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phew. That's a lot. And it required all the data to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So is GeoJSON cloud-native?\n",
    "\n",
    "No.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise confirms it. Sure, it is theoretically possible we could build an index into a GeoJSON file, to be able to read it in pieces, feature by feature. We could consider this new theoretical index like kerchunk but for vectors. We'd have to index the various attributes of our features and have a way to search on them to figure out what byte ranges we would need to read to get those features out of the larger GeoJSON feature class in object storage. This is starting to get complex...\n",
    "\n",
    "But GeoJSON itself does not provide this. There's no metadata in the file itself that tells us how to do this selective reading. The idea above even points out that if we did have start and end offsets for each feature we'd still not know which of those we'd want to read without some higher level of attribute index layered on top. Again, nothing like that is in GeoJSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data interchange format, like a request or response format for an HTTP API, it makes perfect sense not to include such indexing in GeoJSON. Of course, as a data interchange format it's lack of streamability is a problem, but that's orthogonal to our cloud-native concerns here (not to say that it can't be hackily streamed using things like [geojson-stream](https://github.com/node-geojson/geojson-stream); of course it's also worth mentioning [GeoJSONSeq](https://stevage.github.io/ndgeojson/), a new-line delimited format for streaming features)."
