    "# The well-knowns: text and binary\n",
    "\n",
    "Two related formats for representing geospatial vectors are Well-Known Text (WKT) and Well-Known Binary (WKB). Let's take a look at these formats as WKB in particular will be important once we get to GeoParquet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are WKT and WKB?\n",
    "\n",
    "### WKT\n",
    "\n",
    "WKT is a simple text format for geometries. It's basically the stripped-down version of GeoJSON's geometry structure. Three examples follow of a point, line, and polygon geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Point geometry\n",
    "  * GeoJSON\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```json\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"type\": \"Point\",\n",
    "        \"coordinates\": [53, 5]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * WKT: `POINT(53 5)`\n",
    "* Line geometry\n",
    "  * GeoJSON\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```json\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"type\": \"LineString\",\n",
    "        \"coordinates\": [\n",
    "            [30, 10],\n",
    "            [10, 30],\n",
    "            [40, 40]\n",
    "        ]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * WKT: `LINESTRING(30 10, 10 30, 40 40)`\n",
    "* Polygon geometry\n",
    "  * GeoJSON\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```json\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"type\": \"Polygon\",\n",
    "        \"coordinates\": [[\n",
    "            [0, 0],\n",
    "            [4, 0],\n",
    "            [4, 4],\n",
    "            [0, 4],\n",
    "            [0, 0]\n",

    "\n",
    "  * WKT: `POLYGON((0 0, 4 0, 4 4, 0 4, 0 0))`\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice: geometry type keyword, then coordinates in parentheses. No nesting, no attributes—just the geometry. In both cases notice the coordinate pair order is `X, Y`, which in WGS84 (EPSG:4326) makes these coordinates `longitude, latitude` order. Notably, WKT can express coordinates in any CRS: unlike GeoJSON post-RFC 7946, it is not limited to just WGS84 coordinates. The CRS reference must be supplied separately, typically Spatial Reference Identifier (SRID) metadata or external documentation; OGC defines two WKT formats for CRS representations, which are not to be confused with the WKT format for geometries we are discussing here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### WKB\n",
    "\n",
    "WKB encodes the exact same structure as WKT, but in binary format to increase the compactness of the representation at the cost of human readability. For any geometry, its WKB contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Byte order marker (1 byte): 0x01 for little-endian, 0x00 for big-endian\n",
    "* Geometry type code (4-byte integer): 1=Point, 2=LineString, 3=Polygon, etc.\n",
    "* Geometry data: Structure depends on type\n",
    "\n",
    "Point coordinates are encoded as a pair of double-precision float values (8 bytes each). When the geometry type is a compound type (LineString, Polygon...) then it is also necessary to list the number of fields in that type, i.e., how many points are in a line, how many rings are in the polygon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our polygon example `POLYGON((0 0, 4 0, 4 4, 0 4, 0 0))`, for instance, could look like this (written in hex-format bytes):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "01                                                # Endianness (little)\n",
    "03 00 00 00                                       # Geometry type: 3 (Polygon)  \n",
    "01 00 00 00                                       # Number of rings: 1\n",
    "05 00 00 00                                       # Number of points in ring 0: 5\n",
    "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  # Point 0: (0.0, 0.0)\n",
    "00 00 00 00 00 00 10 40  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  # Point 1: (4.0, 0.0)\n",
    "00 00 00 00 00 00 10 40  00 00 00 00 00 00 10 40  # Point 2: (4.0, 4.0)\n",
    "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 10 40  # Point 3: (0.0, 4.0)\n",
    "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  # Point 4: (0.0, 0.0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in this trivial example, the representation is not actually more compact than the WKT representation. With real-world coordinate values like `174.76536299052356`, the WKB representation ends up 2-3× smaller than the WKT string representation before compression (of course, if you are asking \"why 64-bit double floats instead of fixed precision values\": don't get me started, I don't understand it either--I can only think early GIS software used floats and the inertia continues to this day).\n",
    "\n",
    "But the data size is not the real benefit of WKB: it's actually the parsing speed that really matters. It is much more efficient to take these binary values and unpack them directly into numeric types without string-to-float conversion, handling delimiters, etc. At scale with millions of geometries this makes a massive difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "WKB actually comes in three flavors: standard, extended, and ISO. In short, extended and ISO allow for the specification of additional coordinate values in the case of Z or M values. Extended also allows for the optional specification of an SRID. More on the WKB spec can be gleaned from the [libgeos documentation](https://libgeos.org/specifications/wkb/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Is this a CNG format? Why do we care?\n",
    "\n",
    "Great question! No, this WKT and WKB are decidedly not CNG formats. They're not really data formats themselves, they just define how to encode geometries in text and binary formats, respectively. So we don't generally use WKT or WKB by themselves, but as a way to represent a geometry in a larger data object or file. This is exactly why we need to talk about them, because GeoParquet (which we'll look at in the next exercise) uses WKB encoding to store geometries. This exercise is really just a necessary prerequisite to help us make the jump from the easy-and-human-readable-but-not-CNG GeoJSON format to the much more complex GeoParquet format by preparing us for what we'll be reading out of a GeoParquet's geometry column."
