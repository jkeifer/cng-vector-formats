# Exploring Cloud-Native Geospatial Formats: A Hands-on Workshop for Vector Data

Dig into geospatial vector formats—including GeoJSON, WKT/WKB, and cloud-native
GeoParquet—using Python to see in detail how vector features are stored in each
format and to understand what cloud-native means for vector data.

[Slides for the 2026 FOSS4G Workshops are
here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e8uUF99BBLlzIPyIokFMPP1iZS0xQxBaQjuWTI11f7E)

Using the [docker execution
method](#running-locally-with-docker-recommended-for-local-executions) may be
the best option due to the uncertainty of conference internet quality. But
GitHub Codespaces can be a good fallback option for those that want/need a
simpler solution.

> Notebook 03 requires at least 2.5GB of available memory to run. Ensure you
> have this available on your system. If the notebook kernel crashes at any
> point it is likely due to not enough available memory.

## Workshop Overview

Ever wonder what DuckDB is doing under the hood when you open a Parquet table?
How can it so performantly chew through massive amounts data when executing
queries? How can it do so when running over the network against files stored in
object storage?

Cloud-native geospatial is all the rage these days, and for good reason. As
data sizes grow, layer counts increase, and analytical methods become more
complex, the traditional download-to-the-desktop approach is quickly becoming
untenable for many applications. It’s no surprise then that users are turning
to cloud-based tools to scale out their analyses, or that traditional tooling
is adopting new ways of finding and accessing data from cloud-based sources.
But as we transition away from opening whole files to now grabbing ranges of
bytes off remote servers it seems all the more important to understand exactly
how cloud-native data formats actually store data and what tools are doing to
access it.

This workshop aims to dig into how cloud-native geospatial data formats are
enabling new operational paradigms, with a particular focus on (Geo)Parquet.
Participants do not need an existing familiarity with Parquet: we’ll work
together to develop a understanding of the concepts behind the format, starting
with GeoJSON and progressing from there, roughly as follows:

* GeoJSON: what is it, what does it represent, and how it is not cloud-native
* Well-Known Text/Binary (WKT/WKB): how these vector formats work and why they
  are important in (Geo)Parquet
* (Geo)Parquet: how does parquet store data, how geo maps into that paradigm,
  and what it takes to read some subset of data from a parquet table

The content of this workshop aims to be not only theoretical but practical: a
strong goal is to be as hands-on with these formats as possible by working with
them in Python. We’ll eschew common tools, opting to take a more manual
approach where possible. Using the educationally-focused Parquet library
[por-que](https://github.com/jkeifer/por-que) will give us a deeper view into
the process of reading Parquet files, their metadata, and techniques used to
performantly run queries. Throughout, we’ll be building up working
understanding of what common higher-level tooling does under the hood and
abstracts away from users.

### Prerequisites

This workshop expects some familiarity with geospatial programming in Python
and a basic understanding of the vector data model and its utility. Most of the
notebook code is already provided, so any gaps in understanding don't
necessarily prohibit completing the exercises. That said, some knowledge of the
geospatial vector formats and tooling is quite helpful.

Working through [the author’s raster formats
workshop](https://github.com/jkeifer/cng-raster-formats) is also encouraged but
optional.

## Getting Started

The interesting contents of this repo are, primarily, the Jupyter notebooks:

* [`./notebooks`](./notebooks) holds the exercise notebooks to work through
  during the workshop.
* [`./notebooks-completed`](./notebooks-completed) holds the completed version
  of each exercise, for reference or if you get stuck.
* [`./notes`](./notes) holds the exercise notes.

Note that notebook 03 reads live [Overture Maps](https://overturemaps.org/)
data, discovering the latest Overture release automatically via their STAC
catalog—no updates or configuration required as new releases come out.

To facilitate easily running the notebooks in a properly-initialized
environment, a docker compose file is provided. The project can also be run in
a GitHub codespace without having to run anything locally. Alternately, one can
set up their own python environment and run Jupyter without a dependency on
docker.

Docker compose is the recommended approach if wanting to keep all services
local (due to bad internet and/or concerns about leveraging GitHub services).
GitHub codespaces are recommended if considering ease of use alone.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember, this branch is `workshop`, so all the clone commands below require
> you to select the `workshop` branch (or switch to it once you clone).

### Running locally with docker (recommended for local executions)

Using docker has the advantage of better constraining the execution
environment, which is also set up automatically with the required dependencies.

Note that the instructions below were written with a MacOS/Linux environment in
mind. Windows users will likely need to leverage WSL to access a Linux
environment to run docker.

To begin, clone this repo:

```commandline
git clone --branch workshop https://github.com/jkeifer/cng-vector-formats.git
cd cng-vector-formats
```

Ensure the docker daemon or an equivalent is running via whatever mechanism is
preferred (on Linux via the docker daemon or podman; on MacOS via Docker
Desktop, colima, podman, OrbStack, or others), then use `docker compose` to
`up` the project:

```commandline
docker compose up
```

This will start up the Jupyter container within docker in the foreground. If
preferring to run compose in the background, add the detach option to the
compose command via the `-d` flag.

JupyterLab will be started with no authentication, running on port 8888 (by
default; use the env var `JUPYTER_PORT` to change it if that port is already
taken on your machine). Open a web browser and browse to
[`http://127.0.0.1:8888`](http://127.0.0.1:8888) to open the JupyterLab
interface. Select a notebook from the `notebooks` directory and work through
it.

### Running locally using `uv`

This approach is less recommended as it is more subject to local environment
differences than the docker-based approaches. But it does have the benefit of
not requiring docker as a dependency. For users on Linux or MacOS that have
experience managing a python environment, this may quite honestly be the best
option.

Note that the instructions below were written with a MacOS/Linux environment in
mind. Windows users will likely need to leverage something like [git for
Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and the included Git BASH tool to follow
along (WSL is also likely a viable solution to get a Linux environment on a
Windows machine). **This notebook has not been tested on Windows**, however, so
the other options are strongly recommended over this one for Windows users.

To get started, clone this repository and start up JupyterLab using `uv run`.
Users will need to have `uv` installed to use this option.

```commandline
git clone --branch workshop https://github.com/jkeifer/cng-vector-formats.git
cd cng-vector-formats
uv run jupyter lab
```

The `uv run jupyter lab` will create a virtual environment with a compatible
version of python, install all dependencies, then launch JupyterLab. A web
browser window should automatically be launched with this project loaded.
Select a notebook from the `notebooks` directory and work through it.

### Running in GitHub Codespaces

This method does not require any environment setup, repo cloning, or having to
execute any code locally. All this option requires is a GitHub account and a
web browser, making it simple solution for many users. However, it does depend
on an external, web-based service, which may not be ideal in environments with
unknown internet quality (i.e., conferences).

To use GitHub Codespaces, first login to GitHub. Then, go to this link
https://codespaces.new/jkeifer/cng-vector-formats/tree/workshop and click the
green "Create Codespace" button.

(To do the same as that link manually, browse to [the project repo in
Github](https://github.com/jkeifer/cng-vector-formats). There, click the green
`<> Code` dropdown button, select the `Codespaces` tab in the dropdown menu. On
that menu click the three dot menu and select "New with options...". On the
screen the opens changes the branch to the `workshop` branch, usa all the other
defaults, and click the green "Create Codespace" button.)

The codespace will launch in a new browser tab, running the web version of VS
Code. The notebooks can be opened and executed directly in this interface. The
notebook kernel will need to be selected to execute code; choose the `.venv`
kernel from the existing Python Environments option.

Codespaces also have experimental JupyterLab support. For users that might want
to try this, wait for the codespace to fully initialize. Then, go back to the
repo in GitHub and open the codespaces dropdown menu (you will likely need to
refresh the page). You should see the codespace listed, and a button with three
dots `...` next to it. Click that button to open a menu with more actions for
the codespace, then select "Open in JupyterLab". Select a notebook from the
`notebooks` directory and work through it.

## Untrusted Notebooks

If when running a notebook certain cell outputs (folium maps, particularly) do
not display and instead show an error about the notebook not being trusted,
press CMD+Shift+P / CTRL+Shift+P to bring up the command pallet, then type
"Trust Notebook". Select the command with that name to trust the current
notebook.
